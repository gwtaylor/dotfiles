My dotfiles repo.

To make it work on a new Linux install:
  * This repository contains submodules, need to do: git submodule init; git submodule update
  * Copy all packages in ~/elisp from NYU to ~/elisp
  * Clone solarized from git://github.com/altercation/solarized.git into ~/src
  * Once you get to this point, install the following with package-list-packages (using key i to mark for install)
     * anything
     * anything-match-plugin
     * anything-config
     * anything-show-completion
     * python-pep8
     * python-pylint
