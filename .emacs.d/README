Emacs configuration; set up to run with both Aquamacs and GNU emacs on Linux
For Aquamacs, I have the following in ~/Library/Preferences/Aquamacs Emacs/Preferences.el:

;; Based on Aquamacs Emacs Starter Kit
;; http://github.com/walter/aquamacs-emacs-starter-kit
(setq kitfiles-dir "~/dotfiles/.emacs.d")

;; set up our various directories to load
(add-to-list 'load-path kitfiles-dir)
(require 'init)


TODO

-It's a little ugly that (require 'defuns) is necessary before the other (require 'x) but this is due to the system-based functions that need to do some conditionals for paths, etc
Could break up into defuns-early,defuns-late
-It's ugly that there's system conditionals at the beginning of init and at the end (i.e. in their own files)
It would be nice to keep it totally separate in system-specific files, but some statements that are common to all platforms (like color-theme-initialize) require certain paths to be set before calling them
-The conditionals for loading darwin.el and linux.el are of a different form; mainly because system-type could be "gnu/linux" and I don't want to deal with the slash in the name
