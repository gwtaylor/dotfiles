Emacs configuration; set up to run with both Aquamacs and GNU emacs on Linux
For Aquamacs, I have the following in ~/Library/Preferences/Aquamacs Emacs/Preferences.el:

;; Based on Aquamacs Emacs Starter Kit
;; http://github.com/walter/aquamacs-emacs-starter-kit
(setq kitfiles-dir "~/dotfiles/.emacs.d")

;; set up our various directories to load
(add-to-list 'load-path kitfiles-dir)
(require 'init)
